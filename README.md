# CppModules42

 The CPP modules cover a range of topics in C++ programming, providing with a<br>
comprehensive understanding of the language and its features. These modules <br>
are designed to equip with the skills and knowledge necessary to develop<br>
complex and efficient C++ applications.<br>
<h3>The CPP modules include topics such as:</h3>
<pre>
1)Introduction to C++: Basic syntax, data types, variables, and control structures.<br>
2)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.<br>
3)Standard Template Library (STL): Understanding and utilizing various containers <br>
(like vectors, lists, maps, and sets), iterators, algorithms, and functional programming techniques.<br>
4)Memory Management: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, smart pointers, and memory leaks prevention.<br>
5)Exception Handling: Handling runtime errors and exceptions using try-catch blocks.<br>
6)File I/O: Reading from and writing to files using file streams and stream manipulators.<br>
7)Advanced Topics: Templates, lambda expressions, move semantics, and multithreading.<br></pre>
